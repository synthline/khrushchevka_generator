#####__BACKLOG__#####

test spaces with apartments (preety much the same)

try starting to attach some constraints such that every apartment needs to be connected to a staircase.

basd on a input no, shuffle between horiz and vert. 
compute total possible combinations numbers.

integrate room -> area -> apartment -> building


ALWAYS COMPUTE THE TOTAL POSSILBE COMBINATIONS.
